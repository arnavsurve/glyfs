# Tools & MCP

Overview of tool integration and Model Context Protocol (MCP) support in Glyfs agents.

## Overview

Glyfs agents can be enhanced with external tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows agents to:

- Access external APIs and services
- Perform computations and data processing
- Interact with databases and file systems
- Execute specialized functions

## Tool Events in Streaming

When agents use tools during streaming responses, you'll receive `tool_event` messages. The structure varies based on the MCP server implementation.

### Basic Tool Event Format

```json
{
  "type": "tool_event",
  "content": "",
  "data": {
    "tool_name": "example_tool",
    "status": "executing",
    "result": "...",
    "error": null
  }
}
```

### Common Tool Event States

- **`executing`**: Tool is currently running
- **`completed`**: Tool execution finished successfully  
- **`failed`**: Tool execution encountered an error

## MCP Integration

Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to connect AI systems with external tools and data sources.

### MCP Server Configuration

MCP servers are configured at the agent level and provide specific capabilities to your agents.

### Popular MCP Tools

Common categories of MCP tools include:

- **File System**: Reading and writing files
- **Database**: Querying databases
- **Web**: Making HTTP requests
- **Computation**: Mathematical calculations
- **API Integration**: Third-party service integration

## Development

For developers building MCP tools:

1. Follow the MCP specification
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Provide clear status updates during execution
4. Return structured results

## Examples

Tool usage examples are integrated throughout the API documentation:

- **[Streaming API](/api/streaming)** - Tool events in streams
- **[JavaScript Examples](/examples/javascript)** - Handling tool events
- **[Python Examples](/examples/python)** - Processing tool responses

## Next Steps

- Review the [Streaming API](/api/streaming) for tool event handling
- See [Examples](/examples/) for tool integration code samples
- Check the official MCP documentation for protocol details
